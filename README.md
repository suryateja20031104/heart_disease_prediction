# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction App

## 🏥 Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction App** is a user-friendly web application built using **Streamlit** that allows users to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions, helping individuals make informed health decisions.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Interactive User Interface** – Easy-to-use form for entering patient details  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** – Predicts heart disease risk using a trained model  
✅ **Real-Time Predictions** – Get instant results based on user inputs  
✅ **Model Accuracy Display** – Shows the model's training accuracy for transparency  
✅ **Secure & Efficient** – Uses a pre-trained model for quick responses  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for frontend UI)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for model training & evaluation)
- **Pickle** (for model serialization)

## 🏗 How It Works
1. The user enters their health parameters such as **age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.**
2. The trained machine learning model processes the input.
3. The application predicts whether the user is at risk of heart disease.
4. The user receives an instant message indicating their heart health status.

## Installation & Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 Usage
- **For Patients & Individuals** – Assess heart disease risk.  
- **For Healthcare Professionals** – Used as an initial screening tool.  
- **For Developers & Researchers** – The code can be modified and improved.  

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- 🚀 **Improved Accuracy** – Train with more diverse datasets.  
- 🚀 **Additional Features** – Include more medical parameters.
